🔄 Core Workflow

📘 Borrow Book Flow


Member requests a book
BorrowingService validates:
Member status
Borrow limit
Book availability
Borrowing record is created
Book inventory is updated
Due date is assigned automatically


⚠️ Business Rules
Suspended members cannot borrow
Expired members cannot borrow
Borrow limit must not be exceeded
Books must have available copies
Overdue borrowings are tracked automatically


🧪 Testing

Run tests:

bundle exec rspec
Includes:
Model validations
Associations
Scopes
Callbacks
Services
Business logic


📊 Sample Domain Logic
def overdue?
  return false unless due_date.present?
  return false if returned?

  Date.current > due_date
end
def can_borrow?
  active? && active_borrowings.count < max_books_allowed
end


🚀 Setup Instructions
git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-cloud.git
cd book-cloud
bundle install
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

📌 Future Improvements
Email / SMS notifications
Admin analytics dashboard
Advanced search filters
Docker support
